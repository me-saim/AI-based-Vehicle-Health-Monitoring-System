### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vehicle-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set up the missing files**
   
   You'll need to create the following files that are referenced in the HTML:

   **style.css** - Create the stylesheet with:
   - Responsive grid layouts for dashboard cards
   - Modern UI components (buttons, alerts, progress bars)

   - Vehicle selection and switching
   - Real-time data updates
   - Diagnostic functions
   - Report generation
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - AI chatbot interactions
   - Alert management

3. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Or simply open index.html in your browser
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser
